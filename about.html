          Cybersecurity is essential, because the threats are real – and growing. Malicious actors, ranging from individual hackers to established governments, regularly attempt to penetrate public and private infrastructure. They’re often successful. The complexity of modern systems, with all of their cyber, physical, and human components, usually presents many avenues of attack, some of which will be much more damaging than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Achilles Heel Technologies was founded to provide a uniquely powerful and effective cybersecurity solution. Based on cutting-edge research, Achilles Heel enables government and commercial customers to model their complex systems, see where they’re vulnerable, and understand which successful attacks would be most damaging. Forewarned is forearmed, allowing much more effective defense and elimination of the serious vulnerabilities.
